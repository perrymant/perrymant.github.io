I've been writing some music for a film my brother is creating. <!--more-->
It's called "Sweet Sickness" (the book by Patricia Highsmith features in it). I've got a few small snippets, but I like the one I've been working on today, and could probably develop it into a fully fledged song at some point (whenever that is!)
I wanted to include a sound snippet as well, because I've been meaning to add a few more sound excerpts to the blog.
